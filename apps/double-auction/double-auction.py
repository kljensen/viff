# Double auction test. The double auction is implemented as described
# in "Secure Integer Computation with Applications in Economics", a
# PhD Progrees Report by Tomas Toft.
#
# The double auction finds the market clearing price in an auction
# where sellers can specify how much they want to sell at a given unit
# price, and where buyers specify how much they want to buy. The sell
# bids increase (since you want to sell more if the price per item
# increases) whereas the buy bids are decreasing.
#
# TODO: This implementation cheats by not distributing the sell and
# buy bids. This was originally simpler to program it that way.
#
# TODO: Note also, that the players must be run with the same seed.
# This is necessary to obtain consistent shares. This restriction will
# be removed when the shares are distributed correctly as per the
# previous TODO item.
