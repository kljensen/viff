"""This program is a very simple example of a VIFF program which shows
the secret equality testing of two numbers.

The program can be run as follows for each player (min 3) where 24 is
the number we would like to compare:

$ python equality.py player-X.ini -n 24

Only the numbers of player 1 and player 2 are actually compared, but
more players are necessary for the security.
