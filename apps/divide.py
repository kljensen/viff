"""This program does a secret division between two secret shared
values. It is of course mostly meaningless for this example (you can
compute the inputs from your own value and the output).

The program can be run as follows for each player (min 3) where 24 is
the number we would like to divide (by):

$ python division.py player-X.ini 24

Only the numbers of player 1 and player 2 are actually used, but
more players are necessary for the security.
