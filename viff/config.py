"""Functions for loading and saving player configurations. Each player
participating in a protocol execution must know some information about
the other players, namely their hostname and port number. The player
also needs to know something about itself, namely the keys used for
pseudo-random secret sharing (PRSS).

The :class:`Player` class encapsulates this information. Generating a
player configuration is done using the :func:`generate_configs`
function. The :file:`generate_config_files.py` script uses that
function to generate a player config and save it in a number of
:file:`.ini` files. Such a :file:`.ini` file can be loaded with the
:func:`load_config` function.
