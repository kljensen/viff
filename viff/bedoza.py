    A share in the BeDOZa runtime is a pair ``(x_i, keys)`` of:

    - A share of a number, ``x_i``
    - A n-tuple of keys, ``keys``

    The :class:`Runtime` operates on shares, represented by this class.
    Shares are asynchronous in the sense that they promise to attain a
    value at some point in the future.

    Shares overload the arithmetic operations so that ``x = a + b``
    will create a new share *x*, which will eventually contain the
    sum of *a* and *b*. Each share is associated with a
    :class:`Runtime` and the arithmetic operations simply call back to
    that runtime.

    The runtime is used for sharing values (:meth:`secret_share` or

    done through overloaded arithmetic operations, but it is also
    possible to call :meth:`add`, :meth:`mul`, etc. directly if one
    prefers.
