    def shamir_share(self, inputters, field, number=None, threshold=None):
        """Secret share *number* over *field* using Shamir's method.

        The number is shared using polynomial of degree *threshold*
        (defaults to :attr:`threshold`). Returns a list of shares
        unless there is only one inputter in which case the
        share is returned directly.

        In code it is used like this::

            a, b, c = runtime.shamir_share([1, 2, 3], Zp, x)

        where ``Zp`` is a field and ``x`` is a Python integer holding
        the input of each player (three inputs in total).

        If only a subset of the players provide input it looks like
        this::

            if runtime.id == 1:
                a = runtime.shamir_share([1], Zp, x)
            else:
                a = runtime.shamir_share([1], Zp)

        Instead of branching when calling :meth:`shamir_share`, one
        can give ``None`` as input::

            if runtime.id == 1:
                x = int(raw_input("Input x: "))
            else:
                x = None
            a = runtime.shamir_share([1], Zp, x)

        which might be practical in some cases.
