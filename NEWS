Next version, not yet released
------------------------------

PyOpenSSL is now used instead of GnuTLS and this enables secure
connections on Windows. The code dealing with starting a player has
been made much more robust and players can now be started in any
order. Player can now also be reliably shutdown.

* Issue 6: More robust handling of port allocation. We now keep
  retrying until we succeed in binding to the listening port.

* Issue 8: Allow players to be started in any order. Instead of
  crashing, players now retry if the initial connection fails.

* Issue 20: Find a python-gnutls replacement. We now use PyOpenSSL.

* Issue 35: Handle error if TLS is requested but python-gnutls is
  missing. The ImportError is now passed through to the caller.

* Issue 37: Players hang while shutting down. The shutdown procedure
  now correctly waits until all connections are closed before it stops
  the reactor.

* Issue 59: Profiling support. Give a --profile command line argument
  to make your VIFF programs output profiling info when stopped.

* Moved ActiveRuntime and related code to its own module, viff.active.
  This is an incompatible change compared to VIFF 0.6 and you must
  update your code by changing

    from viff.runtime import ActiveRuntime

  to

    from viff.active import ActiveRuntime

* Created mixin classes for different preprocessing choices for
  actively secure multiplication protocol.


Version 0.6, released on 2008-05-28
-----------------------------------

The average time for a secure comparison was reduced by 60-70%.
Comparisons now work with an actively secure multiplication protocol.
A memory leak was fixed. Converted documentation to new Sphinx format.

* A new prss_lsb function in viff.prss efficiently produces a share of
  a random field element together with a GF256 share of its least
  significant bit. This made comparisons 3-4 times faster.

* New default flavors has been added to viff.comparison which uses the
  actively secure multiplication protocol. Actively secure comparisons
  take about twice as long as passive secure comparisons.

* When data was sent and received empty deque objects were left behind
  in the ShareExchanger.incoming_data dictionaries. That caused a
  memory leak which is now fixed. An example application, gc-test.py,
  was added to test this and similar problems.

* The documentation is now generated using Sphinx and aims to be more
  like a manual than purely an API documentation. The extended section
  on program counters is an example of this.

* Fixed a bug that made 'GF256(1) != GF256(1)' return 'True'.

* Calling '~GF256(255)' would throw a KeyError, fixed.

* Issue 19: Make Runtime.convert_bit_share actively secure.


Version 0.5, released on 2008-04-28
-----------------------------------

If python-gnutls is unavailable, players now automatically fallback to
TCP connections. The installation guide was updated for Windows Vista.
Fixed minor typos in documentation.

Details:

* Automatic fallback to TCP if python-gnutls is unavailable. It was
  previously necessary to specify the --no-tls flag when running the
  example applications under Windows since python-gnutls is
  unavailable there. This is now detected automatically at runtime.


Version 0.5rc1, released on 2008-04-23
--------------------------------------

Added preliminary support for preprocessing and an efficient
multiplication protocol which is secure against active adversaries.
The Runtime class has been split into several parts and two new mixin
classes provide different comparison protocols. Several coercion
problems were fixed. The Runtime.callback method was renamed to
Runtime.schedule_callback. VIFF was tested on Python 2.6 and some
small problems were fixed. A new example program was added and the
documentation was updated. Changed license to LGPL.

Details:

* Issue 2: Split Runtime class into smaller parts. The old Runtime
  class has been split. If your program used the greater_than_equal
  method, then you need to use the new Toft05Runtime class from
  viff.comparison. If you used greater_than_equalII, then use the
  Toft07Runtime from the same module.

* Issue 3: Preprocessing. The runtime will now log the use of certain
  methods and this log can be used to preprocess the needed data.

* Issue 7: New system for unit tests. The tests now better simulate an
  asynchronous network by randomly delaying the communication between
  the players.

* Better coercion. The comparison in Toft07Runtime can now correctly
  deal with arguments of mixed types, e.g., comparisons like "100 < x"
  where x is a Share.

* The coercion done by the xor method was also fixed.

* Issue 30: Local multiplication if one operand is a constant. The
  runtime will now avoid an expensive resharing step when multiplying
  shares with constants.

* Issue 22: Allow sending data several times in one method. Previously
  one could only send once to a given players in a given method since
  all communication used the same program counter. The data is now
  correctly buffered on the receiving side.

* Python 2.6 compatibility. VIFF is now regularly tested on Python 2.6
  via a new build slave.


Version 0.4, released on 2008-03-12
-----------------------------------

Implemented a reliable Bracha broadcast which is secure against active
adversaries. Shamir sharings, pseudo-random as well as standard, can
now be asymmetric which means that only a subset of the parties
provide input. The open protocol is now also asymmetric, in the sense
that only a subset of the parties receive the opened result. The
behavior of field elements in Boolean expressions has been fixed. This
means that "GF256(0) and GF256(1)" now returns GF256(0) instead of
GF256(1). Added a modern implementation of the classic Yao
millionaires example from 1982 which started this field of research.

Details:

* Bracha broadcast, which is a reliable broadcast mechanism against
  active adversaries, has been implemented. Secure broadcast is a
  building block that is often used in active security scenarios.

* Asymmetric Shamir sharing. It is now possible to specify that just a
  subset of the players should provide input to a Shamir sharing. This
  change is not backwards compatible with version 0.3 or earlier.
  Adapting old programs is easy, simply change:

    a, b, c = rt.shamir_share(Zp(input))

  to

    a, b, c = rt.shamir_share([1, 2, 3], Zp, input)

  where Zp is a field and rt is a Runtime.

* Asymmetric pseudo-random secret sharing. As the asymmetric Shamir
  sharing above, this is not backwards compatible. This can be fixed
  by changing statements such as e.g.

    a, b, c = rt.prss_share(Zp(input))

  to

    a, b, c = rt.prss_share([1, 2, 3], Zp, input)

  where Zp is a field and rt is a Runtime.

* Asymmetric open protocol, meaning that it is now possible to specify
  that only a subset of the players should receive the opened secret.
  This change is not backwards compatible in cases, where threshold is
  explicitly passed as a parameter. To correct this, name the
  threshold parameter, e.g. change

    result = rt.open(sharing, rt.threshold * 2)

  to

    result = rt.open(sharing, threshold=rt.threshold * 2)

* Overloaded exclusive-or operations on Share instances. Given two
  shares a and b, one can now do

    c = a ^ b

  to obtain the exclusive-or. This works for both GF256 shares and Zp
  shares, though the two types must not be mixed.


Version 0.3, released on 2007-12-27
-----------------------------------

Secure communication between the players were implemented using TLS.
An included Makefile can generate the needed certificates. The network
layer was completely reimplemented, this breaks compatibility with
programs written for VIFF version 0.2 or earlier.


Version 0.2, released on 2007-11-14
-----------------------------------

Implemented overloaded arithmetic operators, so 'w = x + y * z' now
adds and multiplies the three shares as expected. Updated API
documentation. Released using a Distutils setup.py script.


Version 0.1.1, released on 2007-10-23
-------------------------------------

Added API documentation and updated the installation instructions.


Version 0.1, released on 2007-10-16
-----------------------------------

First public release.

Implements basic functionality including addition, multiplication,
exclusive-or, and comparison of shares. Shares can be made using
Shamir sharing or PRSS.

Includes a suite of unit tests and example programs.
