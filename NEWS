Version ?, not yet released
---------------------------

The behavior of field elements in Boolean expressions has been fixed.
This means that "GF256(0) and GF256(1)" now returns GF256(0) instead
of GF256(1). Added a modern implementation of the classic Yao
millionaires example from 1982 which started this field of research.

* Bracha broadcast, which is a reliable broadcast mechanism against
  active adversaries, has been implemented. Secure broadcast is a
  building block that is often used in active security scenarios.

* Asymmetric Shamir sharing. It is now possible to specify that just a
  subset of the players should provide input to a Shamir sharing. This
  change is not backwards compatible with version 0.3 or earlier.
  Adapting old programs is easy, simply change:

    a, b, c = rt.shamir_share(Zp(input))

  to

    a, b, c = rt.shamir_share([1, 2, 3], Zp, input)

  where Zp is a field and rt is a Runtime.

* Overloaded exclusive-or operations on Share instances. Given two
  shares a and b, one can now do

    c = a ^ b

  to obtain the exclusive-or. This works for both GF256 shares and Zp
  shares, though the two types must not be mixed.


Version 0.3, released on 2007-12-27
-----------------------------------

Secure communication between the players were implemented using TLS.
An included Makefile can generate the needed certificates. The network
layer was completely reimplemented, this breaks compatibility with
programs written for VIFF version 0.2 or earlier.


Version 0.2, released on 2007-11-14
-----------------------------------

Implemented overloaded arithmetic operators, so 'w = x + y * z' now
adds and multiplies the three shares as expected. Updated API
documentation. Released using a Distutils setup.py script.


Version 0.1.1, released on 2007-10-23
-------------------------------------

Added API documentation and updated the installation instructions.


Version 0.1, released on 2007-10-16
-----------------------------------

First public release.

Implements basic functionality including addition, multiplication,
exclusive-or, and comparison of shares. Shares can be made using
Shamir sharing or PRSS.

Includes a suite of unit tests and example programs.
