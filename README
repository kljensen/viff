PySMPC: Python Secure Multi-Party Computation
=============================================

This is a general framework for doing secure multi-party computations.
The aim is to offer a secure, fast basic for writing SMPC protocols.

Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions.


Current Status
--------------

The framework offers the following:

* arithmetic with shares from Zp or GF(2^8).
* secret sharing based on Shamir and PRSS.
* addition, multiplication, exclusive-or of shares.
* comparison of secret shared Zp inputs, with secret GF(2^8) output.
* all computations are symmetric and involve three or more players.

All operations are automatically scheduled to run in parallel meaning
that an operation starts as soon as the operands are ready.

The TODO file lists a number of ideas for future work.


Example Applications
--------------------

The apps directory contains a number of example apps. They require
player configuration files to be generated in advance, use
pysmpc/generate_config.py for that. Then execute three players,
starting with player 3, then 2 and finally 1.
