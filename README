VIFF: Virtual Ideal Functionality Framework
===========================================

This is a general framework for doing secure multi-party computations.
The aim is to offer a secure, fast basis for writing SMPC protocols.
Please see the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Current Status
--------------

VIFF is still under development and should be considered a "proof of
concept". While not being done, VIFF is nevertheless quite usable and
currently offers the following features:

* secret sharing based on standard Shamir and pseudo-random secret
  sharing (PRSS). Please note that shares are sent in the clear over
  standard TCP connections. We will use SSL as needed in the future.

* arithmetic with shares from Zp or GF(2^8): addition, multiplication,
  exclusive-or.

* two comparison protocols which compare secret shared Zp inputs, with
  secret GF(2^8) or Zp output.

* computations with any number of players for which an honest majority
  can be found.

All operations are automatically scheduled to run in parallel meaning
that an operation starts as soon as the operands are ready.

The TODO file lists a number of ideas for future work.

Should you encounter a bug or have problems with VIFF, then please
start by downloading the latest version on http://viff.dk/. If that
does not help, then ask for help on the VIFF mailing list at

  viff-devel@viff.dk

Example Applications
--------------------

The apps directory contains a number of example apps. They require
player configuration files to be generated in advance, use
apps/generate_config_files.py for that. Then execute three players,
starting with player 3, then 2 and finally 1.
