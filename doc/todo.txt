Planned Work on VIFF
====================

This document collects the bigger pieces of work we plan to do on
VIFF --- pieces too big for the bug tracker.


Active Security
---------------

The protocol implemented in :mod:`viff.active` is (believed to be)
secure against active adversaries, but only as long as they don't
actually try to cheat! In other words, the players will crash in bad
ways if malformed data is received or too few shares are received.

The following points should be addressed:

* Error correction. The honest players must tolerate being sent wrong
  shares or no shares at all from the corrupt players.

  This is related to Issue4_, Issue29_, and Issue70_.

  .. _Issue4: http://tracker.viff.dk/issue4
  .. _Issue29: http://tracker.viff.dk/issue29
  .. _Issue70: http://tracker.viff.dk/issue70

* Byzantine agreement. After the preprocessing phase a Byzantime
  agreement protocol should be run in order to determine if all honest
  players are ready to continue.

  At the moment an honest players simply aborts the protocol if it
  detects any form of cheating --- the "idea" being that this will
  make the other honest players crash too, thereby effectively halting
  the protocol.
