The algorithms used by VIFF are published in various academic papers.
Here we will try to point out which parts of the code uses which
papers.

* The ``viff.shamir`` module is obviously based on [Shamir79]_.

*  ``apps/millionaires.py``: Inspired by [Yao82]_.

* The default comparison operation (``Runtime.greater_than_equal``) is
  based on the comparison protocol from [Toft05]_.

* Broadcast (``Runtime.broadcast``) is based on the original paper by
  [Bracha84]_ and on the explanation by [Cachin05]_.

* The pseudo-random secret sharing (PRSS) in ``viff.prss`` is
  described in [CDI05]_. The
  :meth:`viff.runtime.Runtime.prss_share_bit_double` method uses a
  protocol described in [Damgård08]_.
