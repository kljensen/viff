Developer's Guide
=================

This page explains what you need to know if you want to start hacking
on VIFF. In addition to these instructions you will want to read up on
the `coding style`_ used by VIFF (it is the normal Python style,
nothing fancy there).

.. _coding style: coding-style.html


Getting the Source Code
-----------------------

VIFF is developed using Mercurial_ (also known as ``hg`` after its
command line program). This is a distributed revision control system
which allows you to participate fully in the development even if you
do not have what is traditionally known as "commit access". You can
also work offline and take advantage of the many fast operations
offered by Mercurial.

.. _Mercurial: http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/

After installing Mercurial you can checkout a copy of the source using
this command line::

   hg clone http://hg.viff.dk/viff/

This will create a directory called ``viff/`` where you will find the
source code. Please test that VIFF works as expected on your computer
by following the instructions on `unit testing`_.

.. _unit testing: unit-testing.html


Contributing Changes
--------------------

When you have created a new feature or fixed a bug, then you need to
send your changes to one of the VIFF developers. If you share a file
system with one of the developers, then the easiest way to get your
changes back into VIFF is to ensure that one of the developers has
read access on the repository files. He can then simply pull the
changesets over and eventually push them out to the VIFF repository.

Alternatively, you can setup a Mercurial repository where one of the
developers can ``hg pull`` from. You can do this by uploading your
clone on some public web server (any webserver works for this since
the developers can pull using ``hg pull http://...``) or by running::

   hg serve -p 8000

which creates a web server on port 8000 just like the one running at
http://hg.viff.dk/viff/. The default port number is 8000, so you can
leave that out.

A final option is the patchbomb_ extension for Mercurial, which will
allow you to use::

   hg email -t viff-patches@viff.dk -o

to send the changesets not present in the VIFF repository (``-o``) to
the VIFF patches list (``-t viff-patches@viff.dk``). You will
probably want to test using a ``-n`` flag or by sending the patches to
your own address first to make sure everything looks okay. You can get
the full list of options using ``hg help email``.

                      wiki/index.cgi/PatchbombExtension

The advantage of using patchbomb is that allows everybody to go over
the code and comment on it before the changesets are pulled into the
repository. The mails sent out by patchbomb contain all the metadata
needed (name of committer, date, parent changeset, etc.) for importing
the changes into the repository, just as if the changesets had been
pulled using ``hg pull``.


Revising Changes
----------------

When developing your changes you will probably make many commits
representing contained steps. Even though you have made a commit, you
can still change it *as long as you have not shared it with anybody*.
The idea is that you are allowed to rewrite history as you see fit in
your own private repository, but if your changes have been pulled to
the outside, then you can no longer change them.

Also, you can only change commits in a linear history back from your
repository tip. This means that if you pull in changes from the main
VIFF repository and merge them periodically, then you can no longer
edit changesets past the last merge. We therefore recommend that you
develop your feature until you are satisfied with it and only merges
with whatever new changesets there might be in the VIFF repository
when the feature is done and debugged.

Now, to change a past commit you use the `Mercurial Queues extension`_
also known as MQ. It gives you a powerful set of tools to work with
the past history. The basic concept is that changesets can be
converted into patches, which depend on each other and form a stack.
Like any good stack, you can push and pop elements from it. In this
case you push and pop patches.

To get started you will want to import the normal changesets into MQ.
Let us suppose you found an error in revision 430 (use ``hg view`` or
``hg log`` to find the revision numbers). You then want to import
revision 430 and the following changesets into MQ with this command::

   hg qimport -r 430:tip

Nothing much happened — your working directory is left unchanged. To
see that the command did something you can check the current patch
series with ``hg qseries``. When importing changesets revision N is
called ``N.diff`` in the patch series.

What we want is to pop off the other patches so that ``430.diff`` is
the topmost patch. This is done with::

   hg qgoto 430.diff

This updates your working directory to look exactly like it did when
you originally committed revision 430! You can now edit the files to
correct the error you found, and when you are done you run::

   hg qrefresh

to refresh the patch in ``430.diff``. You can use ``hg qrefresh -e``
to edit the commit message too. Now comes the fun part — you must now
push the the other patches back on the stack with::

   hg qpush -a

If this goes well with no complaints, then you can finish the patches
again with::

   hg qfinish -a

The end result is a completely normal repository with no sign of this
surgery. You can repeat this as many times as needed to slowly develop
your patches until you are satisfied with the results.


If the changes you made to the patch are conflicting with other
patches in your stack, then the pushing will stop where the error was
encountered, and the conflicting patch hunk is stored in a ``.rej``
file. There is no need to panic if this happens — all you need to do
is to determine how the hunk in the ``.rej`` file(s) should be applied
(if at all) and then run ``hg qrefresh`` to indicate that the current
patch is okay. Now continue applying patches with ``hg qpush -a`` and
fix any remaining conflicts.
