Overview
========

VIFF allows you to write a program which will interact with other
programs in order to execute a joint computation. This is called a
multi-party computation, MPC for short.

The programs will implement what we call a virtual :term:`ideal
functionality` (IF). The idea is that the behavior of the programs
should be indistinguishable from the behavior of programs interacting
with a so-called ideal functionality. An ideal functionality is a
player that cannot be corrupted, also known as a trusted third party
(TTP).

Interacting with an IF is easy: all players give their inputs to the
IF, which computes the results. The results are then distributed to
the correct players. The inputs and the results are sent over secure
channels, and since the IF cannot be corrupted, this ideal protocol
must be secure.

In the real world there is no IF, but VIFF allows you to implement a
virtual ideal functionality. The behavior of a bunch of programs using
VIFF is indistinguishable from program running in the ideal world. It
is indistinguishable in the sense that everything that can happen in
the real world protocol could happen in the ideal world too. And since
no attacks can occur in the ideal world, no attacks can occur in the
real world as well. Such a multi-party computation (MPC) is called a
secure multi-party computation (SMPC).

Security Assumptions
--------------------

Please note that like all cryptographic systems, VIFF is only secure
as long as certain assumptions are fulfilled. These assumptions
include:

- The adversary can only corrupt up to a certain threshold of the
  total number of players. The threshold will normally be 1/2 of the
  players, so for three players, at most one player may be corrupted
  (there must be an honest majority).

- The adversary is computationally bounded. The protocols used by VIFF
  rely on certain computational hardness assumptions, and therefore
  only polynomial time adversaries are allowed.

- The adversary is passive. Being passive means that the adversary
  only monitors the network traffic, but still follows the protocol.
  We plan to add support for active (Byzantine) adversaries in a
  future version.

The precise assumptions for each protocol will eventually be included
in the documentation for the corresponding method, but this has not
yet been done.

Architecture
------------

VIFF consists of several modules. The :mod:`viff.runtime` module
contains the :class:`Runtime <viff.runtime.Runtime>` and :class:`Share
<viff.runtime.Share>` classes, in which the main functionality is
implemented. The :mod:`viff.field` module contains implementations of
finite fields --- these are the values inside the shares. Other
modules provide support functions.

Layers
""""""

The main functionality in VIFF is implemented in the :class:`Runtime
<viff.runtime.Runtime>` class. This class offers methods to do
addition, multiplication, etc. These methods operate on :class:`Share
<viff.runtime.Share>` instances.

Shares hold either :class:`GFElement <viff.field.GF>` or
:class:`~viff.field.GF256` elements and are created from the
:meth:`~viff.passive.PassiveRuntime.shamir_share` or
:meth:`~viff.passive.PassiveRuntime.prss_share`
:class:`~viff.runtime.Runtime` methods. Shares overload the standard
arithmetic operators, so you can write ``a + b - c * d`` with four
shares, and it will be translated correctly into the appropriate
method calls on the :class:`~viff.runtime.Runtime` associated with the
shares.

A field element contain the concrete value on which we do
calculations. This is just a normal Python (long) integer. The value
is wrapped in an object that will keep track of doing modulo
reductions as appropriate.

So in a nutshell, VIFF has these layers:

- Top-level layer for application programs: There you manipulate
  Python integers or :class:`viff.runtime.Share` instances.

- Runtime layer: The runtime deals with Python integers or shares.

- Field elements: Deals with arithmetic over Python integers, but with
  modulo reductions as needed.
