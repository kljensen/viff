The History of VIFF
===================

VIFF was started by Martin Geisler in March 2007. The original name
for the project was *PySMPC* since it was, well..., a Python library
for doing secure multi-party computations (SMPC). That name was
eventually dropped since it is somewhere between difficult and
impossible pronouncing it in a fluent way. After a vote_ on Martin's
blog, the name was changed to Virtual Ideal Functionality Framework
with the much smoother abbreviation VIFF. The idea is that VIFF allows
you to implement an ideal functionality in software, and can thus be
seen as a framework for building *virtual* ideal functionalities.

Background
----------

VIFF grew out of a research project called SIMAP_ which is conducted
at the University of Aarhus, Denmark in collaboration with the
University of Copenhagen and industry partners. SIMAP is short for
*Secure Information Management and Processing* and the main goal of
the project is to develop tools that can be used to build applications
which use SMPC to solve real-world problems. The tools are a set of
efficient cryptographic protocols and a domain-specific language which
aims to allow normal programmers to use the cryptographic protocols in
an easy and *secure* manner without being security experts themselves.
In January 2008 the SIMAP project ran the `first ever large-scale SMPC
application`_ in which Danish farmers traded sugar beet contracts using
a secure double auction.

The SIMAP project is the successor to the SCET_ project (short for
*Secure Computing Economy and Trust*) which implemented a prototype of
the secure double auction used in SIMAP. The comparison protocol used
is available as :class:`ComparisonToft05Mixin` in VIFF, but people
might still refer to it as the "SCET comparison" on the mailing list.

Problems and solutions
----------------------

While the foundation for the sugar beet auction was being programmed
in Java in the SIMAP project, Martin began experimenting with a new
architecture in Python. The Java implementation was big with about
8,500 lines of code for some 130 classes and interfaces and while
implementing the comparison protocol it had become clear that there
were a number of problems with its design.

Problems
""""""""

We knew from the beginning that it was important to run things in
parallel to use the bandwidth in the most efficient way. So a concept
of "batch jobs" was introduced for grouping parallel operations
together. The problem was that one had to write code for dealing with
combinations of different batch jobs so when implementing a new
operation (such as a comparison protocol) one had to define how a
batch job would look like for the new operation and how the batch job
would be combined with all other types of batch jobs. This severely
limited the modularity since every new piece of code needed to know
about every old piece.

Another problem was that although the high lever interface manipulated
secret shared values as first class objects, the runtime system did
not. Instead the values were kept in a ``HashMap`` and referenced
using integers by the internal runtime code. So extending the runtime
system could not be extended in terms of itself, akin to how the
earliest compilers had to be written in assembler instead of a higher
level language.


Solutions
"""""""""

The `Twisted network framework`_ turned out to be a both simple and
elegant solution to the first problem. The key is the
:class:`Deferred` class which allows the code to treat all operations
equal: they all take deferred inputs and return a deferred output. All
time is spend either working on local data or waiting for more inputs
to arrive over the network. When data arrives the associated callbacks
are immediately executed without regard to what kind of operation they
are. This uniform interface means that as many operations as possible
are executed in parallel. Extending the runtime with new operations is
also much simpler since the framework will take care of running things
in parallel -- new operations work the same as old "primitive"
operations.

It is interesting to note that this design relies heavily on the use
of function pointers, something which Java lacks. Python also supports
anonymous functions (lambda expressions) which are very convenient
with this programming style. It might be possible to design a similar
system in Java by using objects to represent the callbacks, but it
would probably be much more cumbersome.

The problem with representing secret shared values by integers
internally instead of objects could of course have been solved equally
well in Java.
