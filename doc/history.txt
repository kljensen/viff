The History of VIFF
===================

VIFF was started by Martin Geisler in March 2007. The original name
for the project was *PySMPC* since it was, well..., a Python library
for doing secure multi-party computations (SMPC). That name was
eventually dropped since it is somewhere between difficult and
impossible pronouncing it in a fluent way. After a vote_ on Martin's
blog, the name was changed to Virtual Ideal Functionality Framework
with the much smoother abbreviation VIFF.
