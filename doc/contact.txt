Mailing lists
-------------

There are three mailing lists associated with VIFF.

:viff-devel_: This list is for general questions and discussions on
  the development of VIFF. Unless you have a patch, you should send
  your question here.

  Any question can be sent there --- VIFF is still a little rough
  around the edges, so please ask for help if you cannot get VIFF
  working! The list is archived locally_, at Gmane_ (where you can
  read/post over `NNTP using a newsreader`__) and at `The Mail
  Archive`__.

:viff-patches_: This is where you will want to send your patches for
  VIFF. Don't worry about filling the list with huge patch series --
  that is why the list is there!

  You should subscribe to this list if you are interested in
  discussing the latest code before it ends up in the main repository.

:viff-commits_: This is a read-only list. Whenever something is pushed
  to the VIFF repository, a mail is sent to this list with a short
  description of the change.

  Subscribe here if you want to be at the forefront of the
  development.


IRC

If you want to discuss something in realtime with the VIFF developers,
