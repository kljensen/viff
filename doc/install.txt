Installation Guide
==================

VIFF is written in Python and uses the Twisted framework for
asynchronous communication, (optionally) OpenSSL and PyOpenSSL for
secure communication, and GMPY for fast bignum arithmetic. You can
find these components here:

:Python:         http://python.org/
:Twisted:        http://twistedmatrix.com/
:OpenSSL:        http://www.openssl.org/
:PyOpenSSL:      http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/
:GMPY:           http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/

VIFF has been successfully tested with the following versions:

:Python:         2.4.1 -- 2.6.0
:Twisted:        2.5 -- 8.1.0
:OpenSSL:        0.9.8g
:PyOpenSSL:      0.7 -- 0.8
:GMPY:           1.0alpha -- 1.0.3

Please `report back`_ if you find that VIFF works with other versions
than the ones listed here.

Below you will find installation instructions for the different
platforms on which we `test VIFF`_.


Windows
-------

This describes the installation procedure for VIFF on Windows. It has
been tested and verified on Windows XP Professional 2002 SP2 and
Windows Vista Ultimate SP1.

1) Download and install Python_.

2) Include the path to your Python installation (e.g. ``C:\Python25\``)
   in the ``PATH`` system environment variable. One way to edit this
   environment variable is by right-clicking My Computer in the Start
   menu, selecting Properties, Advanced, and then pressing the
   Environment Variables button.

3) Download and install Twisted_.

4) Download and install GMPY_. If you are using Vista, right-click on
   the installer and choose the option to run as administrator.

5) Download and execute an `OpenSSL Win32 Installer`_. Problems have
   been reported when using the latest release, 0.9.8h, so currently
   0.9.8g is recommended.

6) Download and install PyOpenSSL_. Again, run the installer as
   administrator if you are using Vista.

7) Download and install VIFF_. Note that if you are using the
   installer on Vista, you will again need to run it as an
   administrator.

8) Proceed to `testing`_.


Mac OS X
--------

This describes installation of VIFF on Max OS X 10.5.

1) Download and install the full MacPython_ version 2.5 (the
   Python-installation which comes with Mac OS X is not entirely
   up-to-date).

2) Download and Install Twisted_ from source. Notice again that Mac OS
   X comes with a pre-installed version of Twisted, but this is not
   the full Twisted installation. After installation change your
   ``PYTHONPATH`` (in your ``~/.bash_profile``) to::

      PATH="/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages:${PATH}"

3) Optionally: download PyOpenSSL_ and tell us if it works!

4) Download and install GMPY_ following the instructions in
   ``gmpy-1.02.macosx.README.txt`` (under Downloads).

5) Install VIFF from source (see below). If you prefer you can just
   install it in site-packages, it makes no difference. For
   developers, it is perhaps a better solution in to create a symbolic
   link from the site-packages directory to the VIFF Python files
   (``viff/viff/``), as otherwise you need to re-install VIFF each time
   the project is modified.

6) Proceed to `testing`_.


GNU/Linux
---------

VIFF was originally developed on GNU/Linux and is well supported
there. When installing the VIFF dependencies you either have the
option of using your `package manager`_ or to install from source. VIFF
itself must be installed `from source`_.


Using a Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian
  You can install all dependencies by the command::

     aptitude install python-twisted-core python-pyopenssl python-gmpy

Ubuntu
  Install the ``python-twisted-core`` and ``python-gmpy`` using
  Synaptic package manager. This will automatically pull in
  ``python-pyopenssl`` as a dependency.

Gentoo
  The following command will install the dependencies::

     emerge -av twisted gmpy

  Make sure to have the ``crypt`` use flag enabled, otherwise SSL
  might not be available.

If you know how to install using other package managers, please `let
us know`_.

VIFF itself is not yet packaged for any distribution, so you will have
to install it from source as described below.


Installing from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not have permission to use the package manager or simply
prefer to install from source, then (assuming that Python is already
installed) one can easily install VIFF and its dependencies by
downloading and unpacking each of them and executing::

   python setup.py install --home=$HOME/opt

That will install everything under the given prefix. With the above
command the Python modules are installed into::

   $HOME/opt/lib/python

and some programs are installed into::

   $HOME/opt/bin

You should add the first directory to the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment
variable and the latter to the ``PATH`` environment variable.

Bash users can normally do this by adding::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/opt/lib/python
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/opt/bin

to their ``~/.bash_profile`` file, creating it if it is not already
there. Consult the documentation for your shell to learn how
environment variables are set.

If you are doing development on VIFF, you might prefer to make a
symlink from the ``viff`` folder in your repository to a place in your
``PYTHONPATH``, like this::

   sudo ln -s ~/viff/viff /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/viff

Testing
-------

To verify the installation, try out one of the applications. We will
run the millionaires example with three players and a threshold of
one. For this test, we will let all players run on localhost: Player 1
will run on port 9001, player 2 on port 9002, and player 3 on port
9003. The test is done on Windows, but it works the same on the other
platforms. Do the following:

1) Go to the ``viff/apps/`` directory and generate the needed
   configuration files by entering::

     python generate-config-files.py -n 3 -t 1 \
     localhost:9001 localhost:9002 localhost:9003

   The backslash indicates that both lines should be typed as a single
   line in the terminal.

2) Open three separate command prompts and go to the ``viff/apps/``
   directory in each. In the first, type::

     python millionaires.py --no-ssl player-3.ini

   in the second, type::

     python millionaires.py --no-ssl player-2.ini

   and in the last, type::

     python millionaires.py --no-ssl player-1.ini

   The order in which you start the players does not matter. If
   the installation works, you should see something like this from
   e.g. player 3::

      C:\viff\apps> python millionaires.py --no-ssl player-3.ini
      Seeding random generator with random seed 7416
      Not using SSL
      I am Millionaire 3 and I am worth 20 millions.
      From poorest to richest:
        Millionaire 2
        Millionaire 3 (20 millions)
        Millionaire 1
      Initiating shutdown sequence.

   If something went wrong, then please `file a bug report`_ or report
   it on the `VIFF mailing list`_. This will help us improve VIFF.

   If things worked as they should, then you are *also* very welcome
   to send a mail saying so to `VIFF mailing list`_! We would love to
   hear your feedback.
