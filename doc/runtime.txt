Runtime Module
==============

.. automodule:: viff.runtime

   .. autoclass:: Share

      .. inheritance-diagram:: Share
         :parts: 1

      .. automethod:: Share.__init__

      .. automethod:: Share.clone

      .. method:: __add__(other)
      .. method:: __sub__(other)
      .. method:: __mul__(other)
      .. method:: __xor__(other)
      .. method:: __lt__(other)
      .. method:: __eq__(other)

         Overloaded operators. They all call back to the Runtime used
         when the Share was constructed. The reverse-argument versions
         are defined too.

   .. autoclass:: ShareList

      .. inheritance-diagram:: ShareList
         :parts: 1

   .. autofunction gather_shares

   .. autoclass:: ShareExchanger
      :members: sendShare, sendData, loseConnection

      .. inheritance-diagram:: ShareExchanger
         :parts: 1

      .. attribute:: ShareExchanger.incoming_data

         Data from our peer is put here, either as an empty
         :class:`Deferred` if we are waiting on input from the player,
         or the data itself if data is received from the other player
         before we are ready to use it.

   .. autofunction:: preprocess

      See also :ref:`preprocessing` for more background information.

   .. autofunction:: create_runtime

   .. autoclass:: Runtime
      :members:

      .. attribute:: Runtime.id

         Player ID. This is an integer in the range 1--*n* for *n*
         players.

      .. attribute:: Runtime.threshold

         Default threshold used by
         :meth:`~viff.passive.PassiveRuntime.shamir_share`,
         :meth:`~viff.passive.PassiveRuntime.open`, and others.

      .. attribute:: Runtime.program_counter

         Whenever a share is sent over the network, it must be
         uniquely identified so that the receiving player known what
         operation the share is a result of. This is done by
         associating a *program counter* with each operation.

         Keeping the program counter synchronized between all players
         ought to be easy, but because of the asynchronous nature of
         network protocols, all players might not reach the same parts
         of the program at the same time.

         Consider two players *A* and *B* who are both waiting on the
         variables *a* and *b*. Callbacks have been added to *a* and
         *b*, and the question is what program counter the callbacks
         should use when sending data out over the network.

         Let *A* receive input for *a* and then for *b* a little
         later, and let *B* receive the inputs in reversed order so
         that the input for *b* arrives first. The goal is to keep the
         program counters synchronized so that program counter *x*
         refers to the same operation on all players. Because the
         inputs arrive in different order at different players,
         incrementing a simple global counter is not enough.

         Instead, a *tree* is made, which follows the tree of
         execution. At the top level the program counter starts at
         ``[0]``. At the next operation it becomes ``[1]``, and so on.
         If a callback is scheduled (see :meth:`schedule_callback`) at
         program counter ``[x, y, z]``, any calls it makes will be
         numbered ``[x, y, z, 1]``, then ``[x, y, z, 2]``, and so on.

         Maintaining such a tree of program counters ensures that
         different parts of the program execution never reuses the
         same program counter for different variables.

         The :meth:`schedule_callback` method is responsible for
         scheduling callbacks with the correct program counter.

         See :ref:`program-counters` for more background information.
