Installation Instructions for VIFF
==================================

VIFF is written in Python and maintained using the revision control
system Mercurial. It uses the Twisted framework for asynchronious
communication, ConfigObj for configuration files, and GMPY for fast
bignum arithmetic.

  * Python:    http://python.org/
  * Mercurial: http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/
  * Twisted:   http://twistedmatrix.com/
  * ConfigObj: http://voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
  * GMPY:      http://gmpy.sourceforge.net/

VIFF has been tested with the following versions: Python 2.4.3,
Mercurial 0.9.4, Twisted 2.5.0, ConfigObj 4.4.0, and GMPY 1.0alpha.
Things might work with earlier versions, we do not know yet.


Installing on DAIMI
-------------------

On DAIMI you can simply run the install-daimi.sh script:

  % sh ~mg/simap/viff/install-daimi.sh

It will attempt to configure the environment for you. If that fails,
please manually append the directory

  ~mg/opt/lib/python2.4/site-packages

to your PYTHONPATH environmental variable and append

  ~mg/opt/bin

to your PATH environmental variable. You can now checkout the source
with the command

  % hg clone ~mg/simap/viff

That will create a directory called viff. Please append that
directory to PYTHONPATH as well.

If running Bash simply put these three lines

  PYTHONPATH=/path/to/viff/checkout
  PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~mg/opt/lib/python2.4/site-packages
  export PYTHONPATH

into a new file called viff.rc under ~/.daimi-setup/bash/bashrc.d/.


Installing Elsewhere
--------------------

Assuming that Python is already installed, one can easily install the
other dependencies (without being root) by downloading and unpacking
them and then execute

  python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/opt

That will install everything under the given prefix. With the above
command run using Python2.4 the Python modules are installed into

  $HOME/opt/lib/python2.4/site-packages

and some programs are installed into

  $HOME/opt/bin

You should add the first directory to the PYTHONPATH environmental
variable and the latter to the PATH environmental variable.

Bash uses can normally do this by adding

  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/opt/lib/python2.4/site-packages
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/opt/bin

to their ~/.bash_profile file, creating it if it is not already there.

To run VIFF you must configure your Python path correctly by setting
the PYTHONPATH environment variable. In Bash shells this is done by

  % export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/viff/checkout
