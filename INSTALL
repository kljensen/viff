Installation Instructions for VIFF
==================================

VIFF is written in Python and maintained using the revision control
system Mercurial. It uses the Twisted framework for asynchronous
communication, ConfigObj for configuration files, and GMPY for fast
bignum arithmetic.

  * Python:    http://python.org/
  * Mercurial: http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/
  * Twisted:   http://twistedmatrix.com/
  * ConfigObj: http://voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
  * GMPY:      http://gmpy.sourceforge.net/

VIFF has been tested with the following versions: Python 2.4.3,
Mercurial 0.9.4, Twisted 2.5.0, ConfigObj 4.4.0, and GMPY 1.0alpha.
Things might work with earlier versions, we do not know yet. Please
report back if you find that VIFF works with earlier versions than the
ones listed here.


Installing VIFF
---------------

First install the dependencies, preferably by using the package system
for your platform.

If you do not have permission to install the dependencies site-wide,
then (assuming that Python is already installed) one can easily
install them by downloading and unpacking them and then execute

  python setup.py install --home=$HOME/opt

That will install everything under the given prefix. With the above
command the Python modules are installed into

  $HOME/opt/lib/python

and some programs are installed into

  $HOME/opt/bin

You should add the first directory to the PYTHONPATH environmental
variable and the latter to the PATH environmental variable.

Bash uses can normally do this by adding

  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/opt/lib/python
  export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/opt/bin

to their ~/.bash_profile file, creating it if it is not already there.

To run VIFF you must configure your Python path correctly by setting
the PYTHONPATH environment variable. In Bash shells this is done by

  % export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/viff/checkout
